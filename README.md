I am Mitesh Sharma (LEOxian)(The Mouse)

During my studies, The golden period to do innovative work, I decided to create a small website/blog dedicated to all my linux friends and new linux users. Websites creation was quite interesting and the web hosting was a kind of adventurous work for me. So I created blog known as Leolinux.in where I like to post technical know-how.

BLOG

I got the idea to write blog when I was doing linux configuration and got frustated of out of mistakes so thought to go online to find some solution then I looked around many websites but did not find any suitable solution ultimately after spending few hours I did configured it. During those days, finding unix/linux configuration wasn't so easy. I generally found a majority of Linux resources on the web to be either too detailed, too vague or just inaccurate. There were many excellent articles on specific topics, but they were usually part of a general interest publication, and information on related topics.

There just wasn't a site out there that could provide step-by-step configuration for intermediate linux home users who wanted to get their feet wet in linux configuration.

So after a few months I decided that no one should have to repeat my pain and I created some technical notes now those notes are www.leolinux.in blog.

I'd like to thank everyone who visited my blog.
